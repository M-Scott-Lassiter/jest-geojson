## Security

I take security seriously and am committed to working with the open source community to resolve vulnerabilities. To protect users and ensure a coordinated disclosure, please disclose responsibly.

## Disclosure

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in this repository, please [contact me](https://github.com/M-Scott-Lassiter/jest-geojson#contact) directly to report it.

**Do not report security vulnerabilities through public methods such as issues, discussions, or pull requests.**

Please include as much of the information listed below as you can to help me better understand and resolve the issue:

-   The type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, or cross-site scripting)
-   Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
-   The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
-   Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
-   Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
-   Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
-   Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help me triage your report more quickly.

## Response

Once the issue has been fixed, the [CI/CD process](https://github.com/M-Scott-Lassiter/jest-geojson/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#continuous-integrationcontinuous-deployment-setup) will trigger a new build. Once that build releases, I will make a [security advisory](https://github.com/M-Scott-Lassiter/jest-geojson/security/advisories).
